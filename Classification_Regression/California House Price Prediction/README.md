Predicting housing prices is a common and critical task in real estate and finance. This project explores the use of various regression machine learning models to predict housing prices accurately. 

## Dataset

In this project, I use the Kaggle Toxic Comment Classification Challenge dataset, which includes a large collection of Wikipedia comments labeled with various toxicity categories, such as toxic, severe toxic, obscene, threat, insult, and identity hate. The dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge/data).

## Overview

In this project, we aim to create a robust and accurate housing price prediction model by leveraging different regression techniques. We explore and compare the performance of several regression algorithms, including:

- Pycaret - to visualize a bunch of models at once
- CatBoostRegressor
- XGBoostRegressor

We analyze the dataset, perform data preprocessing, handle missing values, and engineer relevant features to enhance the model's predictive power.

## Requirements

To run the project and utilize the Jupyter Notebook, you need the following Python libraries installed:

- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- pycaret
- python ML regression models

You can install these libraries using the following command:

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`house_price_prediction.ipynb`) to explore the project.
3. Follow the step-by-step analysis, data preprocessing, and model training to understand the housing price prediction process.
4. Experiment with different regression models and parameters to optimize performance.

## Results

The project results are documented within the Jupyter Notebook and include model evaluation metrics, visualizations, and insights into the prediction performance of each algorithm.
