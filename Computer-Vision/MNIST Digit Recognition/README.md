Accurately recognizing handwritten digits is a fundamental challenge in the field of computer vision and machine learning. This project explores the use of various machine learning models to achieve high-precision digit recognition on the MNIST dataset.

## Dataset

In this project, we leverage the MNIST dataset, a widely-used benchmark in the machine learning community. This dataset consists of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9). You can access the MNIST dataset through popular machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn or TensorFlow. The dataset can also be found [here](In this project, we leverage the MNIST dataset, a widely-used benchmark in the machine learning community.

## Overview

Our objective is to develop a robust digit recognition model that can accurately identify handwritten digits. To achieve this, we experiment with different machine learning algorithms, including:

- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) - a deep learning approach for image recognition.

We analyze the dataset, perform data exploration, preprocessing and analyzation to enhance the model's predictive power.

## Requirements

To run this project and execute the Jupyter Notebook, ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- tensorflow (for CNNs and Dropouts  )

You can install these libraries using the following command:

pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib tensorflow

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`MNIST_Digit_Recognition.ipynb`) to explore the project.
3. Follow the step-by-step analysis, data preprocessing, and model training to understand the housing price prediction process.
4. Experiment with different classification models and parameters to optimize performance.

## Results

The project's results are documented within the Jupyter Notebook, including evaluation metrics, visualizations, and comparisons of model performance. Achieving high Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F1 Score in digit recognition is the primary goal of this project.
