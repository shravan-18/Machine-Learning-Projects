## Dataset

In this project, I work on a huge dataset over a 100 feature columns and 100,000 rows of data, to determine the emotional state of each person in the dataset based off their feature columns. 
Due to confidentiality constraints, I will not be able to share the dataset over here.

## Overview

Our objective is to develop a robust Machine Learning Model to predict the state of a human based off a set of features. To achieve this, we experiment with different machine learning algorithms, including:

- XGBoost Classifier
- KNeighbors Classifier
- CatBoost Classifier
- Support Vector Machine Classifier
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Gaussian Naive Bayes

We analyze the dataset, perform data exploration, preprocessing and analyzation to enhance the model's predictive power.

## Requirements

To run this project and execute the Jupyter Notebook, ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install these libraries using the following command:

pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`MIC_Competition.ipynb`) to explore the project.
3. Follow the step-by-step analysis, data preprocessing, and model training to understand the housing price prediction process.
4. Experiment with different classification models and parameters to optimize performance.

## Results

The project's results are documented within the Jupyter Notebook, including evaluation metrics, visualizations, and comparisons of model performance. Achieving high Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F1 Score in "Emotional State" Prediction is the primary goal of this project.
